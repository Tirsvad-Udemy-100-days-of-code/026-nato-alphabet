## Purpose and Scope

The epic is [MIL-002] "NATO converter": the console behaviour that turns a typed word into NATO code words.

## Story List

### US-001.01 — Spell a word

**As a** User, **I want** to type a word and see the NATO code word of each of its letters, **so that** I can spell the word clearly over the phone.

**Acceptance Criteria**

- Given the program is running, when I enter `Hello`, then it lists `Hotel`, `Echo`, `Lima`, `Lima`, `Oscar` in that order.
- Given the program is running, when I enter the same word in lower case or upper case, then the result is the same.
- Given the program is running, when I enter a word with a character that is not a letter, then it tells me that only letters are allowed and asks for the word again.
