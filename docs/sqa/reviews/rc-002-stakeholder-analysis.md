| 5 | Conflicting stakeholder interests are identified with documented mitigation or resolution strategies | Pass | Two conflicts, each with a mitigation. |
| 6 | Stakeholder concerns are explicitly traced to Business Case objectives | Pass | Traceability table cites [BC-001] objectives O1 to O5. |

| 8 | Document is understandable and navigable by non-technical stakeholders reviewing their own entry | Pass | Short tables; each entry reads on its own. |

## Language and Domain Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | The Metadata table has a `Language` row and a `Domain` row, and neither is a placeholder | Pass | `Language | en` and `Domain | it` are in the Metadata table. |
| 2 | `Language` is a BCP 47 code and `Domain` is a value from the registry's domain list | Pass | `en` is a BCP 47 code; `it` is in the registry's domain list. |
| 3 | The content (prose and table cells) is written in the stated language | Pass | All prose and table cells are English; the course title is quoted source text. Checked by the stand-in reviewer, who reads English. |
| 4 | The register matches the one the registry gives for the artifact type | Pass | The registry gives IT Professional English for this type; the text matches it. |
| 5 | Domain terms are the PO terms of the domain's dictionary, with no synonyms | Pass | No dictionary (`DICT`) exists yet; the terms letter, code word and NATO alphabet are used consistently with no synonyms. Checked by the stand-in; open to challenge. |
| 6 | Metadata keys, section headings, IDs and statuses are in English | Pass | Metadata keys, headings, IDs and statuses are English. |
| 7 | No translated twin (`<name>.<language>.md`) exists beside the document | Pass | No translated twin of the file exists. |
| 8 | A change of language or domain since the previous accepted version has a Version History row and was reviewed again | Pass | First version; no change of language or domain. |
| 9 | A reviewer competent in the domain, and in the language, has confirmed that the domain terms are used correctly | Pass | The domain is software and IT and the language English; the reviewer stood in for (S01) reads both. A person may challenge this in the run summary. |
| 10 | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use, in the stated language | Pass | Abbreviations are spelled out on first use or are identifiers (IDs, tool names). |

## Overall Verdict

Go — every Mandatory criterion of QC-SA-001 and of QC-LANG-001 passes. The review is a stand-in review by the author's AI and is not independent; it is open to challenge in the run summary.
