## Checklist Results

| # | Criterion | Status | Evidence/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Packages, modules, functions, variables, classes and constants follow PEP 8 casing (`snake_case`, `PascalCase`, `UPPER_SNAKE`) | Pass | snake_case modules, UPPER_SNAKE constants; ruff rule set N passes. |
| 2 | Names state purpose in the domain's language; no unexplained abbreviations, no single-letter names outside tiny scopes | Pass | Names state purpose: `DATA_FILE_NAME`, `LETTER_COLUMN`, `INVALID_INPUT_TEXT`. |
| 3 | Code is produced by the project's formatter and passes its linter with no unexplained suppressions | Pass | `ruff check` and `ruff format --check` pass; no suppressions. |
| 4 | Every function and method signature is type-annotated, including `-> None` | Pass | Test functions are annotated `-> None`; constants are annotated. |
| 5 | No bare `except:`, no swallowed exceptions; specific exceptions are raised and the cause is kept (`raise ... from`) | N-A | No exception handling exists in the skeleton. |
| 6 | No mutable default arguments and no shadowed builtins | Pass | No mutable defaults; no builtin shadowed. |
| 7 | Files, locks and connections are managed with context managers | Pass | No file handles are opened; `Traversable.read_text` closes its own. |
| 8 | Public modules, classes and functions have docstrings that say what, not how | Pass | The module and package have docstrings with `@brief`. |
| 9 | Logging uses `logging`, not `print`; no secrets or personal data in log output | N-A | No output is produced in the skeleton. |
| 10 | Classes and operations trace to the Design Class Diagram they implement; deviations are recorded | N-A | No design class diagram exists for this phase; the skeleton has no classes. |
| 11 | Tests exist for new behaviour, are named for the behaviour, and do not depend on order or the network | Pass | Two tests named for the behaviour test the data file. |
| 12 | Type checker runs in strict mode without errors; `Any` is justified in a comment | Pass | `mypy --strict` reports no issue in 3 files. |
| 13 | Dependencies are declared and pinned in the project's dependency file, none unused | Pass | Zero runtime dependencies; dev tools pinned exactly. |
| 14 | Each piece of knowledge (a business rule, constant, format, validation or query) is defined in one place; code is merged only where it expresses the same knowledge, not where it merely looks alike | Pass | Each literal is defined once in `constants.py`; the test reads names, not copies. |
| 15 | Imports point inward: business-rule modules import no framework, database, UI or delivery-mechanism code, and there are no import cycles | Pass | The package imports nothing; no cycles. |
| 16 | SOLID holds: a class or module has one reason to change; new behaviour is added by extension, not by editing a type test in several places; subclasses honour the contract of their base; protocols are narrow; high-level code depends on protocols or abstract types and receives its implementations | Pass | A module with only constants has one reason to change. |

## Overall Verdict

Go — every Mandatory criterion of QC-PY-001 passes or is not applicable to the skeleton (constants and smoke tests).

## Action Items

| Action | Owner | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | S01 | n/a |
