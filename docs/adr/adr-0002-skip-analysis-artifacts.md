## Context

The journey of the framework offers analysis documents beyond the baseline: KPI definitions, a Business Model Canvas, a BPMN process model and a riskiest-assumption test. The project is a single-evening course exercise with six measurable success criteria already in [BC-001], no commercial model, no business process and no costly belief to test.

Options evaluated:

1. Write all four documents: complete, but each needs a review and adds no decision that the Business Case does not already hold.
2. Write only the KPI definitions: the success criteria would be restated in another file.
3. Skip all four and record the reason here.

## Decision

Skip the KPI definitions, the Business Model Canvas, the BPMN process model and the riskiest-assumption test. The Business Case's Success Criteria table carries the measures, and the baseline documents (Business Case, Stakeholder Analysis, Project Plan, milestones) are not skipped.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Less documentation to keep consistent for a small project.
- The success criteria are stated once, in one place.

**Negative:**

- A reader who expects a KPI document finds the measures in the Business Case instead.
- If the project grows (a package published, more users), the skipped documents must be written then.

## Affected Artifacts

- [BC-001] — its Success Criteria stay the only definition of the measures.
