## Purpose

Decide whether S02 and S03 can understand, set up and run the project from its README and wiki without help, in English, Danish and Bahasa Malaysia.

## Deliverable

The `README.md` built from the framework template with screenshots, and a wiki in English, Danish and Bahasa Malaysia with the same pages and screenshots, published on the git host.

## Go / No-Go Criteria

| # | Criterion (objectively checkable) | Go | No-Go |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `check-readme.sh` reports no finding for the README | Exit code 0 | Any finding |
| 2 | The README steps (create `.venv`, upgrade pip, install, run, test) work on a fresh clone on Windows PowerShell | The run produces the expected output | A step fails |
| 3 | Every wiki page exists in en, da and ms | `check-languages.sh` and a file listing agree | A page is missing |
| 4 | The README and each wiki language show a screenshot | Image files exist and are linked | Missing |
| 5 | The wiki is published and readable on the host | Page requests return success | Any page not found |
| 6 | `doxygen Doxyfile` builds and the README says how | Exit code 0 and the section exists | Missing |

## Dependencies
