## Source Use Case

Spell a Word ([UC-001]) — scenario: main success scenario. The alternate flow 3a (invalid character) is drawn separately below.

## Diagram

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as U
participant ":System" as S
U -> S : requestWord()
S --> U : prompt
U -> S : spellWord(word)
S --> U : codeWords
@enduml
```

Alternate flow 3a, a word with a character that is not a letter:

```plantuml
@startuml
actor User as U
participant ":System" as S
U -> S : spellWord(word)
S --> U : rejection(only letters allowed)
S --> U : prompt
@enduml
```

## System Operations

| Step | Message | Parameters | Return | Use case step |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | requestWord | none | prompt asking for a word | 1, 2 |
| 2 | spellWord | word | the list of code words, or a rejection for a non-letter | 3, 4 and 3a |

## Lifecycle Notes

The tool runs one session per start; it keeps no state between words. The data is loaded once when the session starts.
